Memoment

Memoment is an application for people who want to write reviews of movie, performance, and exhibition.

There are three main features:

1) Write Review

There are two kinds of review that users can write. First one is 'comment' of one or two sentences. Second one is 'review' of long paragraphs with a photo. Users can share their reviews with others.

2) Price Comparison

When they want to reserve tickets, users can compare ticket prices of different reservation platforms using this app. Users can choose one platform and go directly to the reservation website.

3) Recommendation

Based on user's information and reviews, memoment recommends movies, performances, and exhibitions that users may like. Also, on user's feed, memoment gives information about works in which users are interested.
